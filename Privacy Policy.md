RULES ARE BELOW MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THEM ALL!!!!
[IF SOMETHING HAS BRACKETS AROUND IT THEN IT IS IMPORTANT!!!!]
1. Understanding what you need to know
2. What data we collect
3. Why we need this information
4. Where and how to contact us
5. How you can [clear/delete] your information from our game


1. Understand all the rules

You can play and have fun in this game. Meeting up with friends and jumping around from tree to tree!
Must be 13+ to play if you are under 13 and you're caught you will be banned for a month or more.
You can play with strangers and really just anyone you want to play with.
When ever joining and playing the game you are allowing us to see your IP address (go to 2 to understand more about why we need this) this just makes it so much easier to make sure everyone feels safe by banning any bad people that are breaking the rules.
If you do not feel safe with us having this information you can contact us (for instructions go to 5) and we will delete your playfab title player. But
upon having your playfab account removed you wont be able to play again without Playfab making you another account. You may never be able to play the game again after getting your account deleted.
If you are caught being rude or just not following the rules at all then you will be banned. The ban length is up to me you will and you will not be able to play with others for how ever long you are banned for.



2. What data we collect

We collect things such as, Hardware ID, and IP address
An IP Address is the wifi address that you use which allows us to prevent people from making new accounts to evade being banned.
An Hardware ID is the id on your Oculus/Meta headset.
We use these to make sure everyone is following the rules.

3. Why we need this info

[ALL INFO IS STORED ON YOUR PLAYFAB/GORLLA CHASERS ACCOUNT PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL DEVS WON'T USE THIS AGAINST YOU!]
[This info is also used to help you log into the correct playfab account and helps us moderate what you do in game.]
We need this info to be able to ban people that are causing havoc, drama, or just being a bad person. If you ever feel like unsafe with us having personal info then you may contact us on email or discord and we will try to get to your as fast as we can. if you ever see someone bullying, harrassing, or assualting someone else report it to me or one of the mods ASAP. I and the other devs want to be able to prevent bullying as much as possible for your own safety while playing Monkeys Home. We use your Hardware ID to prevent you from connecting to a different WIFI to evade an IP ban.

4. Where and how to contact us

You can contact us on discord or gmail. The links will be given shortly. After I tell you why you may need to contact us.
You may need to contact us to delete your account. (go to 4 to understand better).
another reason could be because someone on the team may have falsely banned you. (please contact us if this happens we will un do it right away!!!)
Here are the links: Discord: https://discord.gg/kurJDuUhKu The Gmail account: WeirdGorillazOfficial@gmail.com

5. How to delete your information from Gorilla Chasers

You can contact the Gmail account given above to ask me to delete your account. It is not always guarenteed that I will answer within a few days.
Whenever your account is deleted you most likely won't be able to play the game again without Playfab automatically making you another account. If you want to play again then you will have to accept the fact that it will make a new account. It is very simple to delete your account all you have to do is ask and I and the team will make sure to delete your account. [UPON ASKING FOR YOUR ACCOUNT TO BE DELETED WE WILL REMOVE YOUR TITLE PLAYER WHICH WILL REMOVE ALL DATA YOU HAD BEFORE SUCH AS, CURRENCY, COSMETICS, ETC, AFTER DELETEING YOUR ACCOUNT YOU AGREE TO HAVE ALL DATA REMOVED FROM GORILLA CHASERS!]
